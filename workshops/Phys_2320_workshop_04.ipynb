For example, if $p$ is how experienced your are at learning, grade in course $= p\\, \\times\\,$ time spent preparing for course. Of course, $p$ might be affected by many factors. For example, if you like the material, you might not need to spend as much time because it would be easier to learn and hence get a good grade. Or perhaps it is a 'heavy' course and it requieres a lot of time to learn everything right.\n",

To get from the acceleration to the velocity you integrate. The relationship we will learn now is computationally simpler, although the philosophical questions are equally enjoyable.

Mass is a complicated quantity in physics, and in fact the kilogram was the last unit in the International System to be defined in terms of fundamental quantities (in 2019). Nevertheless, for this course, we adopt a simple definition: the mass is the proportionality constant between the force and the acceleration. If you need to apply more force to impart an object with the same acceleration as another one, the former is more *massive* than the latter. From this simple definition, we can derive some powerful conclusions, which are true in classical mechanics:\n",
